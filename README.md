## Sorting

Explore various sorting algorithms to understand their efficiency and implementation details.

- [Bubble Sort](sorting/bubble_sort.c) ([Header](sorting/bubble_sort.h)): A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- [Merge Sort](sorting/merge_sort.c): A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into two halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.
- [Quick Sort](sorting/quick_sort.c): A fast, in-place sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy.
- [Insertion Sort](sorting/insertion_sort.c): Builds the sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly taking an element from the unsorted part and inserting it into its correct position.

## Searching

Discover different searching algorithms to find elements efficiently in various data structures.

- [Binary Search](searching/binary_search.c): An efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items.
- [Linear Search](searching/linear_search.c): A simple search algorithm that looks at each element in sequence.
- [Interpolation Search](searching/interpolation_search.c): An algorithm that estimates the position of the target value and performs binary search accordingly.

## Linked Lists

Explore linked list structures with variations such as singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.

- [Singly Linked List](linked_lists/singly_linked_list.c): A basic linked list where each node points to the next node in the sequence.
- [Doubly Linked List](linked_lists/doubly_linked_list.c): A linked list in which each node contains a data element and two pointers, one pointing to the next node and one pointing to the previous node.
- [Circular Linked List](linked_lists/circular_linked_list.c): A linked list in which the last node points back to the first node.

## Trees

Understand tree structures and tree traversal algorithms.

- [Binary Tree](trees/binary_tree.c): A tree data structure in which each node has at most two children.
- [AVL Tree](trees/AVL_tree.c): A self-balancing binary search tree.
- [Post-order Traversal](trees/post_order_traversal.c): Traverse a tree in a post-order manner.

## Queues

Explore queue data structures with different implementations.

- [Queue using Linked List](queues/queue_using_linked_list.c): Implementing a queue using a linked list.
- [Queue using Array](queues/queue_using_array.c): Implementing a queue using an array.
- [Priority Queue](queues/priority_queue.c): A variation of a queue where elements are dequeued based on priority.

## Stacks

Understand stack data structures with various implementations.

- [Stack using Linked List](stacks/stack_using_linked_list.c): Implementing a stack using a linked list.
- [Stack using Array](stacks/stack_using_array.c): Implementing a stack using an array.
- [Enhanced Stack](stacks/enhanced_stack.c): A variation of a stack with additional functionalities.

## Pathfinding

Discover pathfinding algorithms for traversing graphs.

- [Recursive Pathfinder](pathfinding/recursive_pathfinder.c): A pathfinding algorithm that uses recursion.
- [Dijkstra Pathfinder](pathfinding/dijkstra_pathfinder.c): An algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph.

## Algorithmic Challenges

Take on algorithmic challenges to enhance your problem-solving skills.

- [Longest Increasing Subsequence](algorithmic_challenges/longest_increasing_subsequence.c): Find the length of the longest subsequence of a given array of integers.

## Algorithmic Patterns

Explore common algorithmic patterns to improve your problem-solving toolbox.

- [Sliding Window](algorithmic_patterns/sliding_window.c): A technique for efficiently processing arrays or lists by maintaining a set of elements related to a contiguous subarray.

## Algorithmic Analysis

Learn about time complexity analysis and understand the efficiency of various algorithms.

- [Time Complexity Analysis](algorithmic_analysis/time_complexity_analysis.md): Documentation discussing the time complexity of algorithms and their analysis.

## Manual Tests

Conduct manual tests for various algorithms to ensure their correctness.
